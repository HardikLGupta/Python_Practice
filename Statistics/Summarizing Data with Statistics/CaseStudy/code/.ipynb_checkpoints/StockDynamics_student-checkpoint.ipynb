    "### Context\n",
    "\n",
    "A stock market is where buyers and sellers trade shares of a company, and is one of the most popular ways for individuals and companies to invest money. The size of the world stock market  is now estimated to be in the trillions. The largest stock market in the world is the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), located in New York City. About 2,800 companies are listed on the NYSE. In this problem, we'll look at the monthly stock prices of five of these companies: IBM, General Electric (GE), Procter and Gamble, Coca Cola, and Boeing. The data used in this problem comes from Infochimps.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Read the data files IBMStock.csv, GEStock.csv, ProcterGambleStock.csv, CocaColaStock.csv, and BoeingStock.csv.\n",
    "2. Create the data frames \"IBM\", \"GE\", \"ProcterGamble\", \"CocaCola\", and \"Boeing\", respectively. \n",
    "\n",
    "Each data frame has two variables, described as follows:  \n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Date**: the date of the stock price, always given as the first of the month.  \n",
    "2. **StockPrice**: the average stock price of the company in the given month.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Inspiration\n",
    "\n",
    "1. What can we learn about different stocks, how the stock dynamics of these companies have changed over time?\n",
    "2. What can we learn from trends? (ex: increased, decreased, cyclic)\n",
    "3. Which stocks are more risky? When did they peak?\n",
    "4. Is there any noticeable difference in prices during different years? what could be the reason for it? Is it same for each stock?"
